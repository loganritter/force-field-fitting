Creates configurations of noble gases with H2 and N2 dimers for force field parameterization. Two force field types available for fitting:

H2CNO: places a previously mentioned gas on a target atomic index and increments the distance in a straight line

AA: places a previously mentioned gas randomly around the molecular structure within 0.75-1.5 times the vdW radii of the structure

Written specifically for MOFs, but will work with other structures as well.
